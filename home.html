        <h2>Description & Sketch</h2>
        <p>
          The goal of the dishwasher is to wash, clean, and dry kitchenware, yet it seems that many
          users struggle when interfacing with the device. With many different settings and cryptic
          manuals, users must endure several rounds of trial and error to get the dishwasher performing
          the way they would like. Once configured, the lack of feedback results in accidentally opening
          the dishwasher before it is completed, having little idea about when their dishes are dry, and
          many other issues that could be resolved with a more intuitive and informative interface. 
        </p>

                <h3 class="center">Similarities Between Users</h3>
                <p>
                  All the subjects agreed that how the buttons correspond to how the machine 
                  washes the dishes is very unclear. Specifically with the two Option buttons 
                  (left and right), subjects did not know the difference between Heat Dry, High Temp, 
                  and Heat Dry and High Temp. None of the subjects interact with Option Right button, 
                  but all of them agreed that it is likely important to the operation of the machine. 
                  The two light indicators on the side of the device were a mystery to all the 
                  subjects; they were unclear about what Clean and Sanitize indicators are referring to. 
                  Interestingly, all the subjects, upon pushing the start button, put their ear to the 
                  machine and listened for if it was working. They reported having no indication about 
                  if their sequence of button presses resulted in the machine starting. Finally, they 
                  all agree that while knowing the dishwasher is currently running takes a burden off 
                  their chores, they fear the moment of opening up the machine and seeing dirty dishes.

                <h3 class="center">Differences Between Users</h3>
                <p>
                  From the interviews conducted, the primary differentiators between subjects 
                  was their understanding of the buttons, overall satisfaction of the machine, 
                  and operating procedure. From the three people interviewed, each explained the 
                  Cycle button differently: corresponds to the number of dishes in the dishwasher, 
                  pressure and method of spraying water, duration of the wash. Surprisingly, even the 
                  Start button had different protocols for each user: press and hold, press twice 
                  in quick succession, press once then waited 3 seconds and press again. Once the machine
                  was running, subjects reportly accidentally opening the dishwasher because they did not 
                  know it was still running. Some subjects believed they were operating the machine 
                  correctly, while others believed that with a different series of button presses they 
                  could get a better outcome. <br><br><br>

              <h3 class="center">General Observations</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Some of the subjects presented ideas for adding features to the dishwasher including:</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>adding a timer to see when the wash would be completed</li>
                    <li>adding a more clear indicator about when the dishwahser was running. Potentially 
                      a locking device that would prevent the user from opening the door while it was running. </li>
                    <li>adding a window so the user could see the washing in action, causing more satisfaction</li>
                  </ul>
                <li>The learning process was an important part of the overall experience for the users</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>some were shown by the previous user of the washing machine, while others learned through
                      trial and error. 
                    </li>
                    <li>none of the subjects reported consulting a manual or getting certain defintions for how
                      the interface affects how the dishwahser cleans. 
                    </li>
                    <li>clearly, learning to use the dishwasher was not effective given all the subjects doubt
                      their ability to fully control the operations of the machine to produce desired outcomes </li>
                  </ul>
                <li>What users are looking for in their dishwasher</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>while subjects noted that it is, at times, enjoyable to wash dishes, having the assistance
                      of a dishwahser, especially during busy times of the week, relieves stress and free up time 
                    </li>
                    <li>the job of the dishwasher is the same for all subjects: wash, clean, and dry kitchenware</li>
                    <li>lastly, subjects all noted that if the dishwasher is doing its job, then they should not have
                      to think too much about it; unfortunately, the interface on this dishwasher leads to constant problems
                    </li>

        <h3>Persona #1</h3>
        <p>
          Bob is a college student who is often stressed with school work. He is generally disorganized and needs to pay full 
          attention to a given task in order to complete it. Given that Bob is living off-campus for the first time, he has had 
          several added responsibilities - the most time consuming for him being cleaning the dishes. While loading the dishwasher 
          is not too difficult, he never truly learned the ideal settings to run the machine with; he is usually in a rush and ends 
          up just spamming start, regardless of the current active settings. He had used washing machine before that simply worked 
          without him playing with the settings and believed this one would do the same. Unfortunately for Bob, he consistently opens 
          the dishwasher to find dirty dishes. Bob has to run his dishwasher numerous times, all the while piling up dirty dishes in 
          sink and driving up his utility bill.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bob represents the users because he is not open to learning exactly how to use the device, is often in a rush when interfacing 
          with the dishwasher, and  expects the device to work without much of their own effort. Not all users of dishwashers can invest 
          the time to read a manual or run through many iterations of settings to find the ideal one. Bob, like many of the users, see the 
          dishwasher as a simple device that should simply work. When it does, the Bob and users get frustrated. 
        </p>

        <h3>Persona #2</h3>
        <p>
          Steve is a father, husband, and in his mid-50s. He enjoys spending his weekends working on projects around the house and spending 
          time with his family. He also is the designated cleanup crew of the family. After dinner, he pops in his AirPods and zones out to 
          a podcast while scrubbing the dishes. He loads the dishes into the dishwasher and has a refined procedure of settings he follows 
          every time. He knows exactly which buttons are needed and could explain how each functions. When he first purchased the dishwasher, 
          he skimmed the manual and tried out different configurations himself until he found one that worked best. He feels good knowing that 
          he found the best settings to clean his dishes well. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Steve represents the users who have time and patience to seek out how to best use the dishwasher. The idea of not understanding how 
          the machine works and how the buttons cause changing in its performance nags at these users. They were initially frustrated that the 
          machine required them to take time to learn rather than being intuitive, but are now satisfied with its operation.
